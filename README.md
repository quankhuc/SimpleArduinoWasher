# SimpleArduinoWasher
This project implemented a simple Washer that has 3 modes: Economy, Deluxe, and Super Deluxe. Red, green, yellow, and blue
LEDS represented hot water, cold water, the dryer, and locked, respectively, in the simulation of washing cycles. Each
simulation featured its own set of LEDs to depict a real-life dishwasher with a range of different washing cycles.
The simluation of each mode is carried out by LEDs wired on a circuit board.
All electrical components are linked and controlled by the Arduinio board.
